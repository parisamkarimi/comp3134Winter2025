1. What is the definition of a server port?
A server port is a numerical identifier used by a server to listen for and handle incoming network requests from clients. It helps differentiate different types of network services running on the same machine.

Registered ports (1024 – 49151): Assigned to specific applications by IANA.
Dynamic/Private ports (49152 – 65535): Used for temporary or private connections, often for client-side processes.
3. How many bits does the port number represent?
